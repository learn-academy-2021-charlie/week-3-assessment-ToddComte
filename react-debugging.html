<!-- ASSESSMENT 3: React Debugging Challenge -->

<!-- This file contains two React components in an HTML file. This React code is broken. Fix the THREE bugs in the code so the user can draw cards and reset the deck. Note: The components are correctly described in this file structure. There is no need to change the architecture of any code. -->

<!-- To see this component, drag the file tab into the browser. -->

<!-- HINT: Check the console in the browser developer tools for errors. The lines numbers may not match up with the line numbers in your text editor. -->

{/* This was a little bit of a challenge for me the first two are linked in so it was kind of like a-ha moment.The third one was definitely more difficult it took me a while of searching the Internet for answers but I was able to ask one of my teammates and he sent me over an article that he read so I read it and this was the solution I came up with. So now that there are no more errors I can clearly see draw a card click to draw a card and then return cards and shuffle deck.I feel pretty accomplished in the fact that I got this done another week finished looking forward to the next week. */}
