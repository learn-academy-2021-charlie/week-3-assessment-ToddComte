# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer:It Refers to an object that it belongs to. This is placed inside of the code block of the component and has a key value.

  Researched answer: My answer was sort of correct in the fact that it refers to an object. React is made up of two components types the first component type is the one that holds state and the other one doesn't hold a state. So therefore the keyword `this` helps to go in and out of components that hold his state and doesn't hold a state. A state is an object that stores a components dynamic data and determines how the component renders and behaves.



2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager for your code it makes it easier to share your code with other people. It gives you three additional files Node modules, yarn Lock and package.json.

  Researched answer: So I was right yarn is a package manager and it does make it easier for anybody in the world to read your code it also allows you to use other developers solutions to different problems making it easier for you to develop your software. So that is why it Modifies the files in your react application so that I can guarantee a smooth transition from one developer to the other because we all use different text editors.



3. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are things in react that you can actually touch and move around and do things with.They are like a menu item with out props all it is is hardcoded in and props allows you to manipulate and click on as a user.

  Researched answer: Props are how are you pass data from one component to the other as parameters.Props are also like arguments passed into react components they also act like HTML attributes.If Your components have a constructior function the props should always be passed through the constructor also to the react component via the super method and as we know the super method allows you to inherit to the parent.



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: This is the language that react goes to first and then you need to use your curly braces in order to break out from it to use your JavaScript.

  Researched answer: During my research I was reminded that JSX stands for do you have a script XML. JSX is a simple syntax extension of JavaScript and allows us to directly write HTML in react. It is easy to create a template using JSX in react but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.



5. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: This is an Event that happens with inside the model.I know that DOM stands for a document object model. 

  Researched answer: In my research I found out that a DOM eventIs defined as a signal that something has occurred or something is occurring and can be triggered by the user interaction or by the browser. It also allows JavaScript to register different event handler's and elements in a HTML document events are normally used in combination with functions and the functions will not be executed before the event occurs i.e. you click the button.



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: When I read this question it confuse the heck out of me because to me an anonymous function would be like anonymous person which means they don't have a name at all. Which is completely backwards from what we were taught functions are supposed to have names.

  Researched answer: Anonymous functions are a function that is called by their variable name and not the function name. They are often arguments being passed to a high-order function or used for construting the results of a high-order function that needs to return a function. If the function is only used once, or  limited number of times, an anonymous function may be syntactically lighter than using a named function.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: This term describes the ability to render different user interfaces markup if a condition is true or faults.

2. Ruby: This is an interpretive high-level general purpose programming language. It is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection just in time compilation

3. Object oriented programming: Programming based on the concept of objects which can contain data and code.

4. Ruby hash: This is a structure inside of Ruby dad maintains a set of objects which are termed as the key and each key is associated with the value with in it.

5. Ruby blocks: Blocking is a way of grouping statements and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method called. Unlike cash blocks deal with a more broad spectrum while hash is more narrow down I guess you could call it global and local.
